        About me
      </h2>
      <p className='text-justify'>
        My inherent curiosity in my career has led me down numerous paths: finance, event
        planning, project management, and digital marketing. Although they initially
        seemed unrelated, these experiences led to my realization of my passion for tech
        and helped me develop my most-prized skill to this day: T-shaped learning. After
        pursuing a Master‚Äôs degree in Corporate Finance, I tried my hand at multiple
        roles, but it just wasn‚Äôt it, Tech kept calling back to me, which led to a
        position with AD/HOC digital agency. As a self-taught professional, every client
        request and every project was an opportunity for me to grow and to widen my
        skillset. AD/HOC was a fertile playground and the autonomy I was given allowed me
        to work on missions that aligned with my passion. I helped companies use Social
        Media Marketing and Search Engine Marketing effectively to generate conversions.
        With 4+ years of experience in WordPress development under my belt, I broadened my
        skillset to encompass Javascript, React, Node.js and Express as an answer to my
        clients‚Äô growing needs. I love what I do and I go above and beyond my due
        diligence for each client, bridging the gap between marketing and technology. My
        specialties include quickly learning new skills and programming languages, problem
        solving and website optimization. So far I have HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB,
        React, Node.js, Express, Material UI, Redis and Git under my belt. üîç Currently
        targeting Javascript, React and Node.js Opportunities.
